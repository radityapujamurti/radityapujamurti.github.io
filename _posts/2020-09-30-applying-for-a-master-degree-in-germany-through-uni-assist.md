excerpt: Applying to German universities, the efficient way.

[Uni-assist](https://www.uni-assist.de/en/) is a platform that can be considered as the bridge between applicants and German universities. Fortunately, there are a lot of universities in Germany that require us to apply through Uni-assist and not directly to the universities.

The Uni-assist website gives crystal clear [step-by-step](https://www.uni-assist.de/en/) process on how we can apply via its platform.

So, how is Uni-assist beneficial to us?

## Send all documents just once
This is the biggest advantage in my opinion. Compared to other countries/systems, Germany has an extremely neat and streamlined process for application to various universities through Uni-assist.

Imagine without Uni-assist, if we want to apply to more than one universities, we need to send certified copy of necessary documents to each university. This means the total cost increases depending on how many universities we are applying to. Each document will cost us in terms of printing as well as shipment.

Not mentioning the different types of documents required for individual universities, preparing those documents can be a major headache.

With Uni-assist, we just need to upload the documents then send the hard copy to its address only once. Even if we apply to multiple universities, the total cost incurred will be the same as we only send everything one time.

## Online checking for IELTS results
When we choose to use IELTS as a proof of our English qualification, Uni-assist can verify the result online.

Therefore, we do not need to send the hard copy to Germany which costs some fee.

Another money saved in the process!

## Intuitive user interface (UI)
Now this is subjective matter. For me, Uni-assist’s new UI looks and functions much much better than the old version.

As there are so many universities in Germany, it is extremely useful the platform can filter, sort and search accordingly. We can view universities by region, type of degree (bachelor/master etc.)

## Some tips
So those are the main advantages. I would also like to give some personal tips when applying through Uni-assist:

## Prepare all the documents
This step should be done before we apply to any course. Scan all the necessary documents, upload them to Uni-assist at once.

Name the files clearly as well.

The reason is to help the officers at Uni-assist have a smoother process when verifying our documents. They are kindly assisting us, so it would be only proper for us to assist them as well :)

## Get IELTS certificate
Some universities do not indicate clearly whether we need to get an English certificate such as IELTS if we have done our bachelor degree in English.

I would recommend to just take the IELTS test before applying to any university. In my experience a lot of universities in Germany require it.

By having IELTS result ready when applying to university will allow Uni-assist to verify the result online. This means we do not have to send the hard copy to the university in the event it is actually needed.

That’s it! I would like to recommend you to consider German universities for your further studies. The process is simple and convenient, thanks to Uni-assist.

However, it does not mean we should avoid universities that are not listed on Uni-assist. We can always apply to the university directly. It is just that the process will be most likely be more tedious.

Hope this helps!
