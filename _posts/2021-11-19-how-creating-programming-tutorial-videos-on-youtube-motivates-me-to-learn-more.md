excerpt: During semester holiday, I learned how to make programming tutorial videos. Now I appreciate those who can make engaging tutorial videos.

Letâ€™s get straight to the points!

- Even though the content is about what I have learned in the past, I am motivated to explore better ways to do things. Clean code becomes more important when I know the code will be viewed by other people. I normally do not care too much about the quality of my code when creating personal projects.

- Posting videos on YouTube also motivates me to have better time management as I aim to upload weekly. Instead of playing games during holidays, I explore interesting materials that can be useful for other people.

- Understanding some concepts and teaching them require us to have deeper understanding. We can have better grasp of the concepts if we can show how they work in our own words. Videos require us to package the content in our own interesting ways.
Some projects that I already have could be improved as I found inaccurate methods while creating video scripts.

- Other interesting learning points are SEO and other YouTube metrics such as retention rate which shows how engaged our audience is. Interpreting those metrics helps me learn data analytics.

- Through making more videos, naturally I need to learn how to edit videos. I need to edit them fast and effectively. This is useful in my master study as some modules require me to create videos as assignments.

## Motivation
I was rather surprised that there are so many benefits that I can get as a programmer by creating tutorial videos.

Initially I wanted to help those who want to learn programming, more specifically my fellow Indonesian programmers. Currently there are still relatively few programming tutorial videos in Bahasa Indonesia. In other words, it is a way to contribute to my country by sharing what I learned so far.

If you understand Bahasa Indonesia, good news! Here is one video for you:
