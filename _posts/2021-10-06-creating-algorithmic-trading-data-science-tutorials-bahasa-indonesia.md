title: Creating Algorithmic Trading Data Science Tutorial In Bahasa Indonesia
tags: data_science
cover:
excerpt: I noticed there were many cases where people in Indonesia were lured to join 'robot trading' schemes. Marketing materials mentioned the use of AI in trading to achieve unrealistic profit but turned out to be disguised ponzi schemes. So I decided to start creating some tutorials about algorithmic trading in my free time.

Many Indonesians became victim to the crime and the [total loss reached millions of dollars](https://nasional.kontan.co.id/news/kerugian-korban-investasi-robot-trading-capai-rp-59-triliun).

The main factor is due to lack of financial education and sophisticated operation by perpetrators. Coupled with the impact of pandemic, many people were looking for an alternative for extra income.

I hope with the videos and articles I posted, more people in Indonesia will not fall into similar trap in the future.
